# LADWP Tier System and Time of Use Rate Calculator

LADWP has two rate plans, Standard Residential Rate and the Time of Use Residential Rate. Both of these plans are billed bimonthly.

Tier system has three tiers, each with certain allotment of kWh to use. Tier 1 is charged the least with lower kWh allotment and Tier 3 the most. 
Standard Residential Rate system also has two zones, which are determined by zip codes in LADWPâ€™s coverage area, with different kWh allotment per tier system. 
Tier system rates change based on the time of year of energy use. 
Standard Residential Rate power access charge also depends on the highest tier system reached within the past 12 months. 

Time of Use Residential Rates have 3 periods during the day, High Peak, Low Peak, and Base. Base rates are the lowest compared to High Peak rates.
